SSH Log Management Program

Task Description:
Create a Python program that connects to a remote machine using SSH, checks or creates a specific directory on the local host, and handles log files automatically. 
If no directory exists, the program should create one, copy and run a setup script (requirements.sh), then rerun itself to handle logs.

Program Requirements:

1. User Input:
   - The program must take input from the user:
     - SSH hostname or IP address
     - Username
     - Password
      -directory name from user  

2. SSH Connection:
   - Establish an SSH connection to the remote machine using the given credentials.
   - Close the SSH session safely after all tasks are complete.

3. Directory Handling:
   - On the other machine, check for a directory which is input from user 
     - Create it.
     - Display a message: "Directory created successfully."
   Then send requirements.sh file and run it inside the directory created  
   - After execution, rerun the Python program again 
Requirements.sh behavior:
   - The script should
     - Create a folder named logs inside the same directory (if not exists).
     - Go inside the logs directory.
     - Create 26 log files named a.log, b.log, ..., z.log.
     - Each log file should contain a single letter (matching its filename).
     - Print a message when finished: "Logs created successfully."


 - After requirements.sh has run:
Print msg to let you know that all is done  and :
     - Copy the content of each triggered log file into the local host current directory in a copied_logs directory .
     - Create a new text file named copied_files.txt that lists the names of all copied files in  copied_logs directory .

7. Session Management:
   - Ensure the SSH session is closed cleanly after all operations.
Finally dear on GitHub create readme file to explain ur work and share it with us on GitHub on fadliko’s repo
